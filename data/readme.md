# Data Structure

The data used for this project is covered by privacy policy of the client that provided it.\
Therefore, it was not possible to include it in this repository.\
The dataset contained customer feedbacks related to the experience with an airline company.\
The details regarding this dataset can be found in "*Chapter 3: Data & Annotation Study*" of the thesis.


For illustration purposes, an example file, showing the structure of the datasets used for training, validation, and testing, is included to this folder.\
The name of the file is `example_dataset` and can serve as a means for easier comprehension, and future reproducibility, of the code.
